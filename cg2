				<p class="body-artists">CG2 GALLERY is pleased to announce RECENT PAINTINGS featuring artwork by MARY BUCCI McCOY. The exhibition marks Bucci McCoy's first solo exhibition at CG2 GALLERY. The artist will be present during the opening reception on Saturday, October 3rd, 2015 from 6:00PM - 9:00PM in the Track One Building in the vibrant arts neighborhood of Wedgewood/Houston. </p> 

				
				<p class="body-artists">Mary Bucci McCoy approaches painting as focalizing, multivalent sites for connection, interaction, and relationships. According to Bucci McCoy, " I use non-objective painting to subtly address philosophical and existential questions of presence and experience through resolutely material interrogation. My work originates with intuitive questions or curiosity rather than with a preconceived idea." Bucci McCoy's impeccable attention to detail is evident in the construction of her panels to the skilled ways she manipulates the acrylic paints that explore and exploit their inherent, unique properties. The exposed directness of her paintings corresponds to the immediacy of the viewer’s connection with the work. The direct, sensual intimacy of the material, marks and facture of all of her works invites the viewer into an experiential dialogue, offering a site of mediation between inner and outer balanced on the fulcrum of the marks.</p>

				
				<p class="body-artists">Mary Bucci McCoy currently lives and works north of Boston, MA. She attended Tufts University/School of the Museum of Fine Arts where she earned a BA in English from Tufts and a BFA in sculpture from the Museum School. Upon graduation she received the Alice Pratt Traveling Scholarship from SMFA Ceramics Department which allowed her to spend a year studying sculpture at l"Ecole des Arts Decoratifs in Geneva, Switzerland. Her work has been included in numerous group and solo exhibitions throughout the country. In addition, Bucci McCoy's paintings have been featured in New American Paintings and New American Paintings: 15 Years.</p>
