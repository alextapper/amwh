				<p class="body-artists"><strong>KEVIN GUTHRIE</strong> - NO STALGIA</p>

				<p class="body-artists">Kevin officially qualifies as my favorite new folk artist. Enjoy what I believe might be the greatest artist's statement ever written, along with a few sneak peeks below.</p>

				<p class="body-artists">Three things keep me youthful: One, eating children's cereal; two, drawing with crayons. Three, still playing T-Ball. I began drawing in May of 2013. The first thing I drew was the horse that won the Kentucky Derby, Orb, who I cashed a ticket on. I bet $100 on him, a huge bet for me, and he won. I won $500.</p>
				

				<p class="body-artists">I had a box of pretty nice crayons, I was getting ready to do recycling, and had torn a beer box apart. I thought, “Wait a minute, if I just draw on this ...” And I just started drawing Orb. Crayon on the back of beer boxes has remained my preferred medium.</p>
				
				<p class="body-artists">At my 50th birthday party, in January 2014, I got a lot of gifts, so I decided to hand out drawings to my friends to say thank you. I hadn't really given the drawings much thought, but the positive reaction gave me the drive to take it more seriously. I had my first show in March 2014 at the 444 Pop Up outside Julia Martin Gallery.</p>
				

				<p class="body-artists">I draw things that I like, things that make me happy, things that I'm envious of. Most of my drawings are inspired by icons of American culture — movies, music, art, sports, literature. I can't paint a Picasso, but I can draw Picasso with a crayon.</p>
				

				<p class="body-artists">Stream of consciousness sometimes plays a role in my subject matter as well. After drawing Haven Hamilton, the character Henry Gibson played in Nashville, I thought to myself, “Hmmm, Henry Gibson ... Henrik Ibsen.” And the seeds of my next drawing were planted.</p>
				

				<p class="body-artists">I've always loved Gil Scott-Heron's “B Movie,” and one of my works was inspired by the line, “[Americans] don't know whether they want to be Matt Dillon or Bob Dylan.” (Matt Dillon the marshal, not the actor.)</p>
				

				<p class="body-artists">Other subjects include the Bee Gees, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder in the movie Stir Crazy, Louis Prima, Willie Mays. Several pieces have been inspired by Robert Altman films: The Henry Gibson piece, Julianne Moore in Short Cuts, Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould in MASH, Gould and George Segal in California Split.</p>
				

				<p class="body-artists">Perhaps the subconscious plays a part in some of my works. If so, maybe a therapist can explain to me the significance of my piece, “Truman Capote Holding a Fucking Cat.”</p>
