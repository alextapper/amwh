				<p class="body-artists">The Packing Plant is excited to exhibit Virginia Griswold in Equal Parts, opening October 3 from 6-9pm during the First Saturday Art Crawl in Wedgewood/Houston, Nashville, TN. </p>

				<p class="body-artists">As part of Virginia Griswold’s continued exploration of multiples, Equal Parts pulls ideas from two different bodies of work to create new groupings, taking form as a sculptural tableau vivant composed of specimens, fragments, and forms from her studio. Bringing together sculpture, casting, and photography, she finds connections between her personal practice and the metaphorical act of ‘match-making’, constructing relationships between process and product that disrupt a dichotomous understanding of form. At once fleshy and plastic, floral and mineral, Griswold’s objects distort polarized perceptions like natural/unnatural and finished/unfinished, exposing the falsity of simple binaries.</p>
				
				<p class="body-artists">Virginia Griswold is an artist based in Nashville, Tennessee. She received an MFA in Sculpture from Alfred University, Alfred, NY and a BFA in Glass/ Material Studies from Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA. She has also studied at the Maryland Institute College of Art, Pilchuck Glass School, and the Penland School of Crafts. In 2009, she received a Brooklyn Arts Council Re-Grant to fund the project: What it is, What it will be: Objects Found and Altered in Brooklyn, as well as, a fellowship in Sculpture from the New York Foundation for the Arts. In 2011 she was awarded a residency fellowship to study at the the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris. She has also been an artist-in-residence at the Gullkistan residency in Laugarvatn, Iceland. She is currently an Assistant Professor of Sculpture at Austin Peay State University.</p>

			<p class="body-copy light grey">Currently, exhibitions run as one night pop-up events during the First Saturday Art Crawl of every month from 6-9pm.</p>

			<p class="body-copy light grey">The Packing Plant is curated by Ann Catherine Carter and Zack Rafuls and owned by Jon Sewell.</p>
