				<h2 class="body-current-exhibit">Current Exhibit:</h2>

				<p class="body-artists">THE X SOUNDS //<br>Taking the imagery from The X Housewife Portraits, Burlei label produces unique and curated sounds, a scored experimentation that results in a musical adaptation of the visual. Interpreting image through sound, hand picked musicians compose in their own words the feeling behind the visual works of artist, Kit Kite -- creating a Burlei soundtrack that unifies both the audio and visual arts.</p>
				
				<p class="body-artists">THE X HOUSEWIFE PORTRAITS //<br>Compassing a series of self-portraits, installation work, video, and performance art, the complete conceptual work of The X Housewife Portraits is a series that documents the artist’s personal process of isolation, displacement within the house and identity within the home. The concept further explores an individual’s objectivity to relationship, materiality, and the human longing to connect to a physical landscape. </p>
			
				<p class="body-artists">In the X Installs (a series of ten black and white portraits that document the suited installs created by Kit Kite) the artist becomes immersed in inanimate household objects, where the common domestic tool is depicted as the setting subject within the self-portrait as Kite remains "the backdrop" in the self-portrait series.</p>
				
				<p class="body-artists">THE EVENT //<br>Fort Houston will be hosting during October's art crawl the album release show, X Sounds. The exhibition will include the visual works of The X Housewife Portraits, the art film documentary: Sounds of X, and live, experimental music performances by contributing artists; Those Darlins, Angel Snow, Joan of the stockyards, Grill Billyenz, and Turnbull Green.</p>

			<h2 class="body-current-exhibit">About the gallery:</h2>

			<p class="body-copy light grey">Fort Houston is a place for you to facilitate, grow, learn and work. We occupy 10,000 square feet in the Wedgewood-Houston neighborhood, complete with a full-scale wood shop, print shop, bike shop, photography studio and miscellaneous work and desk space. Here’s how it works: You pay a monthly membership fee, and you get to make things in here. Oh, and taking a class or two can be fun, too, but you don’t have to be a member to do that!</p>
